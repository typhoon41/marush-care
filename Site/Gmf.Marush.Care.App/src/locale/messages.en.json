It is performed using a dermapen device, which creates numerous small punctures at various depths, facilitating better penetration of active ingredients into the deeper layers of the skin. Dermapen treatment is a leading method for addressing various skin concerns due to its effectiveness. It effectively targets issues such as acne-prone skin, acne scars, wrinkles, enlarged pores, hyperpigmentation, and loss of skin tone, while also restoring skin plumpness and rejuvenating the complexion. The treatment typically comprises a series of four sessions, spaced twenty days apart. While the procedure is generally not painful—thanks to the application of an anesthetic—you may experience mild skin scratching. Post-treatment, redness may occur, and the skin requires approximately 72 hours to recover. During this period, it's advisable to avoid activities such as sauna usage, swimming, tanning beds, facial steaming, and exposure to dust.",
